## Description:

This calendar application allows users to save events for each hour of the day. Starter HTML and CSS files were provided to build upon. The app is dynamically updated and powered by jQuery. 
<br>
<br>

**Application Features:**

The application pulls in the current date using Moment.js. Time blocks are color coded based on past, current and upcoming times: 
- Past time blocks are grayed out
- Current time block is red
- Upcoming time blocks are blue

Users have the ability to enter events and save them so that their plans are still visible upon refresh.
