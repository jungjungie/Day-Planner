**Application Features:**

The application pulls in the current date using Moment.js. Time blocks are color coded based on past, current and upcoming times: 
- Past time blocks are grayed out
- Current time block is red
- Upcoming time blocks are blue

Users have the ability to enter events and save them so that their plans are still visible upon refresh.
